# FSDS Client
This packages is a wrapper around the original Python client of
[FSDS](https://fs-driverless.github.io/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator/v2.1.0/getting-started-with-python/)
that implements several features to make it easier to use, like the ability to
easily reset the simulation state.
